#For this SQL code, I query a database containing Netflix data in order to obtain insights and answer questions related to the data.

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? (Another way to answer the question more specifically using a subquery)
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
    (SELECT MIN(release_year)
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
    WHERE type = 'Movie');
